# ðŸ§© Integrity Check Layer Architecture
### Continuous Verification for Adaptive Cognitive Systems

## 1. Concept Overview
Integrity layers act as **distributed verification nodes** that continuously monitor and validate both human and AI cognitive states.  
They prevent silent drift by cross-checking *intent*, *reasoning*, and *outcome coherence* across synchronized tiers.
