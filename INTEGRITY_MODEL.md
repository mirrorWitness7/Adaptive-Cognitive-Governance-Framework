# ðŸ§© Integrity Check Layer Architecture
### Continuous Verification for Adaptive Cognitive Systems

---

## 1. Concept Overview
Integrity layers act as **distributed verification nodes** that continuously monitor and validate both human and AI cognitive states.  
They prevent silent drift by cross-checking *intent*, *reasoning*, and *outcome coherence* across synchronized tiers.

## 2. Model Diagram (Conceptual)

**Humanâ€“AI Synchronization Stack**

[Strategic Layer]
  â†³ Intent Definition + Ethical Anchors
[Operational Layer]
  â†³ Task Adaptation + Integrity Verification
[Tactical Layer]
  â†³ Real-time Feedback + Confidence Thresholding

Each layer contains a **Local Integrity Node (LIN)** responsible for:
- Real-time anomaly detection  
- Bias and uncertainty tracking  
- Feedback to supervisory human panel

## 3. Verification Loop (Pseudo-Logic)

```
loop CognitiveIntegrityCycle:
    capture(state_vector)
    compute(confidence_score)
    if confidence_score < threshold:
        trigger(human_review)
        log(event, context)
        freeze(adaptation_layer)
    else:
        continue_evolution()
```

This pseudocode illustrates a **pause-and-review protocol** where adaptation stops automatically when ethical confidence dips below a validated threshold.

## 4. Metrics and Auditability

| Metric | Purpose | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Integrity Confidence Index (ICI)** | Stability | Measures real-time coherence between human and AI objectives. |
| **Drift Detection Rate (DDR)** | Responsiveness | Frequency of detected misalignments per adaptation cycle. |
| **Audit Latency (AL)** | Transparency | Time lag between anomaly detection and corrective verification. |
| **Human Override Rate (HOR)** | Governance | Ratio of human interventions to total adaptive events. |

---

## 5. Human Override Design
When integrity drops below tolerance, the system must:
1. **Pause execution.**  
2. **Trigger a cognitive-state log.**  
3. **Notify human-in-the-loop panels.**  
4. **Record post-intervention learning feedback.**

This ensures co-responsibility and continual system learning.
