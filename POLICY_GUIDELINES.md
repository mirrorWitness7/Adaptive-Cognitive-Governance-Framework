# üèõÔ∏è Policy Guidelines for Adaptive Cognitive Governance

---

## 1. Adaptive Regulatory Frameworks
- Employ **iterative oversight cycles** triggered by cognitive transitions.  
- Base compliance on **performance metrics** rather than fixed mandates.

## 2. Transparency of Cognitive Transitions
- Require **auditable logs** of every adaptive change.  
- Record **integrity-check failures** and corrective actions.

## 3. Human Override Protocols with Learning Feedback
- Allow **system pauses** for human verification.  
- Feed results back into **adaptive learning modules** for root-cause understanding.

## 4. Accountability and Liability
- Define **shared liability** among developers, operators, and regulators.  
- Establish **independent auditing bodies** for adaptive oversight.

## 5. Standardized Integrity Check Layers
- Adopt **universal metrics** for confidence and uncertainty.  
- Develop **standardized APIs** for cross-platform regulatory review.

## Implementation Context
This framework aligns with:
- **OECD AI Principles**  
- **EU AI Act**  
- **NIST AI Risk Management Framework**

It positions adaptive cognition as a **governance asset**, not a risk.
