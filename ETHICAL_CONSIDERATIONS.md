# 🧠 Ethical Considerations for Adaptive Cognitive Systems

---

## 1. Maintaining Human Value Alignment
- Continuous monitoring for **value drift**.  
- Regular recalibration via **human-in-the-loop ethical boards**.

## 2. Bias Detection in Adaptive Contexts
- Integrate **dynamic bias detection** in integrity layers.  
- Use **adversarial testing** for fairness resilience.

## 3. Explainable Adaptation
- Maintain **transparent adaptation logs**.  
- Offer **visual dashboards** for human interpretation.

## 4. Human Oversight & Cognitive Load
- Employ **tiered escalation** to prevent alert fatigue.  
- Provide **intuitive monitoring dashboards**.

## 5. Defining Safe Cognitive Transitions
- Pre-define validation criteria for new cognitive states.  
- Require **independent audit** before high-stakes deployment.
